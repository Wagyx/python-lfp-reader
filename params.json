{"body":"=========================================\r\nLFP (Light Field Photography) File Reader\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\n<https://behnam.github.com/python-lfp-reader>\r\n\r\nProvides a Python library and command-line scripts to read Lytro LFP files, and\r\na simple viewer for Lytro LFP Picture files.\r\n\r\nTechnically, there are two types of LFP files: Picture and Storage.  LFP\r\nStorage files are used to store the data and configurations for Lytro cameras,\r\nand LFP Picture (.lfp) files are used to store RAW and/or processed data for\r\nLytro light-field pictures.\r\n\r\nThis is a pure-Python package and should work on any platform.  Please report\r\nany problems at <https://github.com/behnam/python-lfp-reader/issues>.\r\n\r\n\r\nLFP File Format\r\n===============\r\n\r\n*LFP* is a new file format used in *Lytro Light Field* cameras for the RAW and\r\nProcessed picture files, as well as storing camera information in the Lytro\r\nDesktop library.\r\n\r\n**LFP Picture** files have a ``.lfp`` extension, and among these, the name of\r\nthe processed picture files end in ``-stk.lfp``, where *stk* stands for\r\nrefocuse \"stack\".  Embadding JPEG data with some additional refocus data, the\r\n``stk.lfp`` files are designed to be used in the Lytro Desktop application and\r\non the web.\r\n\r\n**LFP Storage** files embed various data files, which are identified by a\r\npathname, i.e. ``C:\\CALIB\\WIFI_MAC_ADDR.TXT``.\r\n\r\n\r\nLFP Scripts\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis package provides the following command-line scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPicture Viewer\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**lfp_picture_viewer.py**\r\n  A small application to view and *refocus* LFP Picture files.\r\n  You may provide the name of the Processed LFP Picture file in the\r\n  command-line.::\r\n    ./lfp_picture_viewer.py samples/IMG_0001-stk.lfp\r\n\r\n  *NOTE: This script requires Python Imaging Library (PIL) to run.*\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Information Scripts\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n**lfp_file_info.py**\r\n  Provides general information about any LFP file, including the metadata and\r\n  the data chunks (data size and their sha1 ids).::\r\n    ./lfp_file_info.py samples/IMG_0003.lfp\r\n  You may also pass the sha1 id to the command line to get the content of the\r\n  data chunk in standard output.::\r\n    ./lfp_file_info.py samples/IMG_0001.lfp sha1-992ae2d9f755077e50de7b9b1357e873885b3382\r\n\r\n**lfp_picture_info.py**\r\n  Provides detailed information about a picture file.::\r\n    ./lfp_picture_info.py samples/IMG_0003.lfp\r\n  The *Frame* section provides the information about the RAW picture data, and\r\n  the *RefocusStack* section provides the information about the processed image\r\n  data, including the number of JPEG files and the size of the depth table.\r\n  You will also get a preview of the depth table.\r\n\r\n**lfp_storage_info.py**\r\n  Providing a list of embedded files in an LFP Storage file.::\r\n    ./lfp_storage_extractor.py data.C.0\r\n\r\n\r\nExporters\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n**lfp_file_exporter.py**\r\n  Exports metadata and data sections of a generic file into separate files.::\r\n    ./lfp_file_exporter.py samples/IMG_0001.lfp\r\n\r\n**lfp_picture_exporter.py**\r\n  Exports raw and processed data of a picture file into separate files.::\r\n    ./lfp_picture_exporter.py samples/IMG_0001.lfp\r\n    ./lfp_picture_exporter.py samples/IMG_0001-stk.lfp\r\n\r\n**lfp_storage_exporter.py**\r\n  Exports all the embedded files of a storage file into separate files.::\r\n    ./lfp_storage_exporter.py data.C.0\r\n  If you give the script a path, you get the content of that specific file\r\n  in the standard output.::\r\n    ./lfp_storage_exporter.py data.C.0 'C:\\CALIB\\WIFI_MAC_ADDR.TXT'\r\n\r\n\r\nLFP Reader Library\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n**LFP Reader library (``lfp_reader``)** provides direct reading access to all\r\ndata and metadata in any LFP files. For the processed LFP Picture files, you\r\ncan easily access the JPEG data and the depth table. And for LFP Storage files,\r\nyou can access embedded files easily using their pathname.\r\n\r\nThe main classes in the ``lfp_reader`` package are:\r\n\r\n- ``LfpGenericFile``\r\n- ``LfpPictureFile``\r\n- ``LfpStorageFile``\r\n\r\n\r\nCode License\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
