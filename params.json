{"name":"python-lfp-reader","tagline":"Python library and command-line scripts to read Lytro LFP files.","body":"=========================================\r\nLFP (Light Field Photography) File Reader\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\n<http://code.behnam.es/python-lfp-reader>\r\n\r\n*Version 2.0*\r\n\r\nProvides a Python library and command-line scripts to read Lytro LFP files.\r\nThere is also an enhanced viewer for Lytro LFP Picture files supporting\r\nlight-field picture refocusing and enhanced-depth-of-field/parallax view.\r\n\r\nThis version supports picture files generated by\r\n*Lytro Desktop application version 2.0*.\r\n\r\nTechnically, there are two types of LFP files: Picture and Storage.  LFP\r\nStorage files are used to store the data and configurations for Lytro cameras,\r\nand LFP Picture (.lfp) files are used to store RAW and/or processed data for\r\nLytro light-field pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Install\r\n==============\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis is a pure-Python package and should work on any platform, but some\r\nfunctionalities depend on external Python and non-Python libraries.\r\n\r\n- Python Imaging Library:\r\n  ``PIL`` (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PIL) or\r\n  ``Pillow`` (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/).\r\n\r\n- GStreamer Python:\r\n  ``gstreamer``, ``gst-python`` and the ``gst-plugins-ugly`` plugin set\r\n  (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/).\r\n\r\nInstall in Ubuntu\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nRun following commands in a terminal::\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev python-gst0.10 gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly python-pip\r\n\r\n    sudo pip install https://github.com/behnam/python-lfp-reader/tarball/master\r\n\r\n\r\nLFP File Format\r\n===============\r\n\r\n*LFP* is a new file format used by *Lytro Cameras* and *Lytro Desktop* app for\r\nRAW and Processed picture files, as well as storing camera software and\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n**LFP Picture** files have a ``.lfp`` extension, and among these, the name of\r\nthe processed picture files end in ``-stk.lfp``, where *stk* stands for\r\nrefocuse \"stack\".  Embadding JPEG data with some additional refocus data, the\r\n``stk.lfp`` files are designed to be used in the Lytro Desktop application and\r\non the web.\r\n\r\n**LFP Storage** files embed various data files, which are identified by a\r\npathname, i.e. ``C:\\CALIB\\WIFI_MAC_ADDR.TXT``.\r\n\r\n\r\nLFP Viewer\r\n===========\r\n\r\n**lfp-viewer.py**\r\n\r\n  An enhanced light-field picture viewer, suppring *refocus* and\r\n  *enhanced depth-of-field/parallax* features.\r\n\r\n  You may provide the name of the Processed LFP Picture file in the\r\n  command-line.::\r\n\r\n    ./lfp-viewer.py samples/IMG_0001-stk.lfp\r\n\r\n\r\nCommand-line Scripts\r\n====================\r\n\r\nThis package provides the following command-line scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\nlfp-file.py\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n**Sub-command: info**\r\n\r\n  Prints general information about any LFP file, including the metadata and\r\n  data chunks (their size and sha1 ids).::\r\n\r\n    ./lfp-file.py info samples/IMG_0003.lfp\r\n\r\n**Sub-command: export**\r\n\r\n  Exports metadata and data sections of a generic file into separate files.::\r\n\r\n    ./lfp-file.py export samples/IMG_0001.lfp\r\n\r\n**Sub-command: extract**\r\n\r\n  Extract the content of a data chunk to standard output, giving its SHA1 id.::\r\n\r\n    ./lfp-file.py extract samples/IMG_0001.lfp sha1-992ae2d9f755077e50de7b9b1357e873885b3382\r\n\r\n\r\nlfp-picture.py\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**Sub-command: info**\r\n\r\n  Provides detailed information about the LFP Picture file.::\r\n\r\n    ./lfp_picture_info.py samples/IMG_0003.lfp\r\n\r\n  The *Frame* section provides the information about the RAW picture data.\r\n\r\n  the *Refocus-Stack* section tells you about the processed image data for\r\n  refocues feature, including the number of refocues images and the size of the\r\n  depth table.\r\n\r\n  the *Parallax-Stack* section tells you about the processed image data for\r\n  EDoF/Parallax feature, including the number of parallax images.\r\n\r\n**Sub-command: exporter**\r\n\r\n  Exports raw, processed data and an all-in-focus image of the LFP Picture file\r\n  into separate files.::\r\n\r\n    ./lfp_picture_exporter.py samples/IMG_0001.lfp\r\n    ./lfp_picture_exporter.py samples/IMG_0001-stk.lfp\r\n\r\n\r\nlfp-storage.py\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n**Sub-command: info**\r\n\r\n  Prints general information about any LFP Storage file, including a list of\r\n  embedded data files (their path and size).::\r\n\r\n    ./lfp-storage.py info samples/IMG_0003.lfp\r\n\r\n**Sub-command: export**\r\n\r\n  Exports metadata and embedded files of an LFP Storage file into separate files.::\r\n\r\n    ./lfp-storage.py export samples/IMG_0001.lfp\r\n\r\n**Sub-command: extract**\r\n\r\n  Extract the content of an embedded file to standard output, giving its path.::\r\n\r\n    ./lfp-storage.py extract samples/IMG_0001.lfp \"C:\\\\CALIB\\\\ACC.TXT\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLFP Reader Library\r\n==================\r\n\r\n**LFP Reader library (``lfp_reader``)** provides direct reading access to all\r\ndata and metadata in any LFP files. For the processed LFP Picture files, you\r\ncan easily access the refocused and parallax data and the depth table. And for\r\nLFP Storage files, you can access embedded files easily using their pathname.\r\n\r\nFor more details, look at the module documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode License\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
